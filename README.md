# stocks-api-project

This beginner project fetches and displays stock information—such as current price, daily high, and low—using a public stock API. It was built with vanilla JavaScript and basic DOM manipulation to practice working with APIs and updating the UI dynamically. The app is not responsive and designed for desktop use, focusing mainly on understanding API integration and data rendering in the browser.
